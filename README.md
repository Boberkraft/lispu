## Macro **ONCE-ONLY** ##

### Syntax: ###

**once-only** *(name&ast;) form&ast;*

######**Arguments and Values:**######

**name** - a symbol.

**form** -a form.

######**Description:**######

Meant to be used in macro code, once-only guards against multiple evaluation of its arguments in macroexpansion code. 
**Any** concise description would be far too vague to grasp.

######**Notes:**######

The description here is frustratingly non-descriptive, and I apologize for that. If you understand once-only and can give a better explanation, I would be very gratefulâ€”not to mention completely awed.
